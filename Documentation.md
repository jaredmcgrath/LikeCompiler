# Phase 1 Documentation

## Keywords

Keywords [array, begin, case, const, div, do, mod, procedure, program, type, until] were removed and [choose, elseif, fun, is, like, pkg, public, using, val, when] were added. This was accomplished by editing the stdIdentifiers file in the parser subdirectory. Corresponding tokens were added/removed in scan.ssl as well (pChoose for the choose keyword).

Predefined identifiers were changed as well, [get, getln, put, putln] were added while [read, readln, write, writeln] were removed.

## Character Classes

Five new character classes were added to scan.ssl for the new Like inputs, and the existing lQuote class was changed to recognize double quotes rather than single. The following table describes the new Like inputs and their corresponding character class name. Character classes were added and altered in scan.ssl in the input declaration. 
<table>
<tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Character Class</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>"</td>
<td>lQuote</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>lSlash</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%</td>
<td>lPercent</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>#</td>
<td>lHash</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>!</td>
<td>lBang</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>|</td>
<td>lBar</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Syntax Tokens
The following new Like symbols were added to `scan.ssl`:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Symbol</th>
<th>Syntax token</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>||</td>
<td>pDoubleOrBar</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>+=</td>
<td>pPlusEquals</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-=</td>
<td>pMinusEquals</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>*=</td>
<td>pStarEquals</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>/=</td>
<td>pSlashEquals</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%=</td>
<td>pPercentEquals</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>==</td>
<td>pDoubleEquals</td>
</tr>
</table>
Rules were added in order to emit these new syntax tokens when appropriate.

The initialization of the character class map was changed in the Initialize procedure of parser.pt. The map at indices corresponding to the ASCII codes of the new characters were initialized with the name of the character class using the 'ord' function. These changes allow the new characters to be pre-screened into character classes and further, scanned as legal tokens within the Like language. 

## Strings

Phase 1 string changes were implemented by changing the `quote` from `'` to `"` in `parser/parser.pt`

## Comments

The existing `Comment` and `AlternateComment` rules in `parser/scan.ssl` were removed. Two new rules, `SingleLineComment` and `MultiLineComment`, were added instead to discard

```like
// Single line comments, and

/*
 * multi-line comments
 */
```

The `Scan` rule was also adjusted to support these changes by first removing the old style `AlternateComment` and then by adding calls to the new comment rules for the `/` character.
