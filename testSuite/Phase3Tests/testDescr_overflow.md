Programs were tested explicitly by running a base program successfully. Statements and declarations - affected by the changes to the `Block` and `Statement` rule - were tested iteratively with if statements, integer constants and integer output statements to ensure the positive logical paths behaved according to the Like specification. Upon this successful step, all other steps relied on combinations of declarations and statements. This includes intermixing declarations and statements, declaring multiple variables on a single line, and performing operations using expressions within statements. This provided full coverage of all the changes made to the `Block` and `Statement` rule. Negative and positive tests were developed to test the scope of intermixed declarations and statements, by trying to access variables of varying types both in and out of scope. 

Statement changes for the Like specification were tested thoroughly by running all of the previous tests in Phase 2 - which covered all positive and negative cases for shortform assignments, repeat while loops, elseif clauses and different choose statements. Additionally, to ensure proper behaviour when handling errors, each logical error path for the above statements was forced to output `eIntegerExpnReqd`, `eDuplicateLabel`, `eUndefinedInteger`,`eIntegerConstReqd` and `eBooleanExpnReqd` by developing negative cases with undesirable selectors, conditions, and duplicate cases.
