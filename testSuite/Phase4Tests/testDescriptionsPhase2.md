# Test Descriptions

## Modifications for Phase 4

If you haven't already read `testDescriptionsPhase4.md`, please do so first before reading this file.

This file is copied verbatim from `Phase2Tests/` (we didn't need to modify any of our test descriptions). There are some positive tests here that passed parser phase which now fail on semantic phase; we leave them in for the sake of preserving the original Phase 2 tests.

Note that the File Name and Expected Output Filename columns have not changed either, although their relative paths are no longer correct. The actual relative paths are as follows:

- For a test with File Name `program_path.pt`, you can find the actual program at `../Phase2Tests/program_path.pt`
- For a test with Expected Output Filename `program_path.pt.eOutput`, you can find the (semnatic phase) expected output at `phase2_eOutput/program_path.pt.eOutput`
- For a test with Expected Output Filename `program_path.pt.eOutput`, you can find the original (parser phase) expected output at `../Phase2Tests/program_path.pt.eOutput`

## Justification for Completeness
For each new language feature or revised syntax, we added at least one positive test case (often with overlap in larger test programs) that demonstrates correct parsing of valid Like code. Test cases were generated for each fork on new logic paths. Like operators have negative tests for invalid/missing operands (String operators, Short form assignment operators, Arithmetic operators, etc.). Multi-keyword statements have a negative test for each logic path where a keyword could be missing or invalid (If/Else, RepeatWhile, etc.). Also, deprecated PT keywords and operators were tested to ensure that their functionality had been invalidated. e.g. `program output;`.

1. Token definitions were tested implicitly, as there is no good way to test the parser on token definitions alone.
2. Programs were tested through 0, 1 and multiple parameters as well as testing the 'using' keyword and invalid keywords.
3. Declarations were tested using both types of declarations (with and without Like keyword), as well as testing syntactically invalid use of the Like keyword.
4. Routines were tested through 0, 1 and multiple parameters as well as testing with invalid parameter separators (semicolons) as well as missing an `end;` statement. All above cases were also done with the optional `public` keyword.
5. Complete package testing coverage is ensured with negative tests involving missing package names and keywords (`is`, `end`, etc.). A positive test includes both a non-empty and empty package.
6. Else-if statements were tested by forcing the parser through each valid logic path with the restrictions of a mandatory if statement, optional multiple elseif statements, an optional else statement and a terminating end;. Negative tests ensured all restrictions were enforced such as the mandatory if, then, and end; tokens. It was ensured that the inclusion of elseif statements produced the same output as a nested if statement, as this was the option chosen.
7. Short form assignments were tested by testing each assignment arithmetically. The negative test was designed with each short form assignment statement flipped (*= vs =*) to ensure these are not accepted.
8. Operator Syntax was tested through proper use of the `\`, `%`, `=`, `==`, `!=` operators. As well, deprecated operators `div` and `mod` were tested to ensure they no longer function as operators. Changed conditional operators `<>`, `=` and assignment `:=` were tested to ensure they cause syntax errors.
9. Complete choose statement testing ensured between negative tests with missing/misplaced/unexpected keywords (`then`, `when`, `of`), missing identifiers (no expression), and invalid structure (no cases, only an `else` case). Positive tests demonstrate valid `choose` statements
10. Repeat and repeat while statements have negative tests for missing expressions, missing keywords (`end`), and invalid structure (missing body). Positive tests demonstrate parsing valid repeat and repeat while statements
11. String operations tested positively with examples of all operators (concat, repeat, substring, length) working correctly in a program. Negative test cases test parsing when invalid/missing operands are specified.
