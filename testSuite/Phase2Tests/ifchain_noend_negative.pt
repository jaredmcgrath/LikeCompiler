/*No end; is included here
to terminate the first if statement. The parser chooses 
the default case within the IfStmt selector, 
which expects pEnd and pSemicolon. 
Since these aren't the next inputs, recovery mode
is entered and the parser pretends it accepted those
tokens and proceeds to terminate the IfStmt with
sEnd and returns to Block. The last if statement is then
parsed without any problems*/
