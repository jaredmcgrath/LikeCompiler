Documentation
Mark: 2/2
- Great documentation.

Structure and Clarity
Mark: 4/4
- It would be helpful to make your comments stand out relative to the original comments in the source code, e.g. by using `%%` instead of just `%` in `.ssl` files.

Testing and Correctness
Mark: 3.75/4
- Excellent, fairly comprehensive test suite, documentation and scripts.
- The test suite should be more comprehensive: e.g., what does the output look like for multiple public constant declarations? What about routines with mixed parameters (some with `var` and some without `var`)? (-0.25)
- Parser is correct. Great work!
